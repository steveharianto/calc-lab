# calc-lab

A small browser-based mathematics calculator I made out of curiosity.  
It uses **[Nerdamer](https://nerdamer.com/)** for symbolic math — it can handle stuff like √, ∫, d/dx, lim, Σ, π — all locally with no backend.  

Built with plain **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
Everything runs offline — just open `index.html`.
